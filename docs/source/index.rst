tidesurf documentation
======================

This is the documentation for **tidesurf**, a Tool for IDentification and Enumeration of Spliced and Unspliced Read
Fragments, implemented in Python. It enables the quantification of spliced and unspliced reads from 10x Genomics
5' and 3' scRNA-seq data, using the 10x Genomics Cell Ranger output.

.. note::

    This project and its documentation are under active development.


.. note::

    In the future, we aim to support other single-cell RNA-seq data formats, such as Smart-seq2.
